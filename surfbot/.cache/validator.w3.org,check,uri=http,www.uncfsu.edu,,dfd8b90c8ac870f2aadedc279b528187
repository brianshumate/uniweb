      The Validator found an end tag for the above element, but that element is
      not currently open. This is often caused by a leftover end tag from an
      element that was removed during editing, or by an implicitly closed
      element (if you have an error related to an element being used where it
      is not allowed, this is almost certainly the case). In the latter case
      this error will disappear as soon as you fix the original problem.

      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).
    </p>
    <p>
      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in
      the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no
      supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error
      message for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, 
      (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or 
      check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or
      use CSS instead of this attribute. If you received this error when using the

      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.
      This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a
      "style" element in the "body" section instead of inside "head" -- or
      two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML
      documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error
      can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's "self-closing"
      tags for "meta" and "link" in the "head" section of a HTML document may
      cause the parser to infer the end of the "head" section and the
      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not
      allowed; hence the reported error).

      Most likely, you nested tags and closed them in the wrong order. For 
      example &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; is not acceptable, as &lt;em&gt;
      must be closed before &lt;p&gt;. Acceptable nesting is:

      Another possibility is that you used an element which requires
      a child element that you did not include. Hence the parent element
      is "not finished", not complete. For instance, in HTML the &lt;head&gt; element
      must contain a &lt;title&gt; child element, lists (ul, ol, dl) require list items (li,

      depending on the DOCTYPE of the document. For HTML 4.01 Strict, the '/'

      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.
      This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a
      "style" element in the "body" section instead of inside "head" -- or
      two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML
      documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error
      can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's "self-closing"
      tags for "meta" and "link" in the "head" section of a HTML document may
      cause the parser to infer the end of the "head" section and the
      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not
      allowed; hence the reported error).

    <ul>
      <li>putting text directly in the body of the document without wrapping

      <li>forgetting to quote an attribute value

      <li>using XHTML-style self-closing tags (such as &lt;meta ... /&gt;)

      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).

      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).
    </p>
    <p>
      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in
      the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no
      supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error
      message for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, 
      (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or 
      check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or
      use CSS instead of this attribute. If you received this error when using the
